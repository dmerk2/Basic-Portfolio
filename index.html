			<header>About Me</header>

			<hr/>

				<p>I was born in Princeton, NJ at Princeton Hospital. I have 2 brothers, both older and younger, so I am the middle child. My middle name is Scott and I love ice hockey and the NJ Devils. I played ice hockey while growing up and absolutley loved it. I like to eat and enjoy all different types of food. Family is very important to me and I would do anything for them. I have an awesome cat named Lily who is a rescue. Her prior life before coming to live with me is very sad so she knows that shes been saved. My mom lives in Bridgewater, NJ is an NP and my dad lives in Morganville, NJ and owns a Jewish Deli/ restaurant. My older brother, Ross, is 28 and graduating medical school next week. My younger brother, Alex, is 24 and lives in Manhattan working in sales and marketing.</p>
